# How We Work

We believe in working in the open. Everything related to the product — ideas, feedback, discussions, and development — happens publicly and asynchronously.

This helps us stay transparent, focused, and inclusive. It also allows anyone to follow along, join the conversation, or contribute at any time, no matter where they are.

## Asynchronous by Default

We don’t do meetings. We use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/zoonk/discussions), [Projects](https://github.com/orgs/zoonk/projects), Issues, and Pull Requests to collaborate. This gives everyone time to think, write clearly, and respond when they can.

## Public by Default

All project-related discussions happen **publicly**. That includes new feature ideas, roadmap suggestions, bug reports, and general feedback.

We use:

- [Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/zoonk/discussions) for ideas, questions, and proposals.
- [Project board](https://github.com/orgs/zoonk/projects) for tracking progress.

## Exceptions

Some things are handled privately:

- Customer support and individual feedback
- Sales or partnership inquiries
- Anything involving sensitive data

You can reach us by email at hello@zoonk.com for those.

## FAQ

### Are you open to partnerships?

We’re still early stage, so not all types of partnerships are useful right now. That said, we’re open to hearing proposals in areas like:

- Funding or investments
- Hosting, server, or database support
- AI or LLM credits
- Sponsorships

### Can I help with design or marketing?

Maybe. We’re open to contributions in:

- **Design**, especially around branding or UI/UX.
- **Marketing**, but be specific: what you’re suggesting, why it matters, and what you expect the outcome to be. For example: social media posts, campaign ideas, video content, or general strategies.

All suggestions must be made publicly in our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/zoonk/discussions) and include clear tasks or deliverables.

**We’re not offering paid opportunities at this time, but we appreciate all contributions.**

### Can I contribute code?

Not yet. Things are still moving fast and the scope changes often, which makes onboarding hard. We plan to open for coding contributions after the first major releases. Keep an eye on our [main repository](https://github.com/zoonk/zoonk) for updates.

### Are you hiring?

Not right now but feel free to reach out if you’re interested in working with us in the future. Send an email to will@zoonk.com with your resume and a brief note about why you want to work with us. We’ll keep it on file for future reference.

### How to Get Updates?

The best way is to follow us [here on GitHub](https://github.com/zoonk) or on [social media](https://zoonk.com/zoonk/marketing).
