## Why We Are Building This

AI already helps you learn fast. The real gap is knowing what to learn, in which order, and how everything fits together. Zoonk gives you structure. We guide you step by step, help you see what you don’t know yet, and connect the dots so you can turn knowledge into real progress. Our goal is to make learning simple, practical, and connected to your reality.

We believe anyone can learn and build anything.

## How We Work

We build Zoonk with a few core principles:

- **Care**: We obsess over quality. Every detail matters. Talk to people, feel their pain and fix it.
- **Openness**: We build in public. Open-source is our default because collaboration accelerates innovation.
- **Agency**: We take ownership. We identify problems and fix them fast, no blame culture.
- **Growth**: Mistakes drive progress. Learn, adapt, move on. Stay humble.
- **Inclusion**: We build for everyone. Diverse perspectives create stronger solutions.

## Where We’re Headed

We’re starting with an app where you can learn anything with small, interactive activities. Long term, we want Zoonk to become the go-to place for professional and career development: where people go to learn something new, develop skills, find jobs, hire people, and connect with others to build the future together.
