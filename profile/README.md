## 🌍 Why We Are Building This

AI is changing how we live and work. To thrive, people need tools that make learning easier, faster, and more fun. That’s why we’re building Zoonk, because anyone can learn anything and knowledge should be accessible to everyone.

## 🔧 How We Work

We build Zoonk around these values:

- **Care**: Focus on solving real problems with quality, not feature bloat.
- **Transparency**: Open and honest in how we work and decide.
- **Ownership**: Take responsibility, fix problems fast, no blame culture.
- **Sharing**: Open-source by default. Collaboration over competition.
- **Growth**: Mistakes are part of learning. We adapt quickly and stay humble.
- **Inclusion**: Diverse perspectives lead to better solutions. Every voice counts.

We want to accelerate progress by making learning better for everyone. This means building the best tools to help you learn anything—fast, easy, and fun.
