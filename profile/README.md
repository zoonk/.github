## 🌍 Why We Are Building This

AI is changing how we live and work. To thrive, people need tools that make learning easier, faster, and more fun. That’s why we’re building Zoonk, because anyone can learn anything and knowledge should be accessible to everyone.

## 🔧 How We Work

We build Zoonk based on these values:

- **Care**: We care about what we build, who we build it for, and the problems we solve. Quality over quantity—it’s not about having the most features, but the best ones.
- **Transparency**: No secrets, no hidden agendas. We’re open, honest, and direct about everything.
- **Ownership**: We take responsibility. If something goes wrong, we own it, learn, and fix it. We’re proactive—improving things without waiting for permission.
- **Sharing**: Everything we build is open-source. Collaboration beats competition—everyone contributing is part of the team.
- **Growth**: Mistakes fuel learning. We take risks, adapt fast, and stay humble, knowing there’s always more to learn.
- **Inclusion**: Great products come from diverse teams. Different perspectives lead to better solutions. Every voice matters—we make sure everyone is heard, respected, and included.
