## 🌍 Why We Are Building This

Society is changing fast. AI is reshaping how we live and work. To keep up, people need scientific literacy, critical thinking, and a lifelong drive to learn. Education must be fun, practical, and engaging—so everyone can adapt and thrive in a world that never stops evolving.

Some are told that becoming a scientist, an engineer, or an astronaut is impossible. That those paths are not for someone working double shifts, coming home exhausted, raising two kids.

Of course, it’s harder. But that’s exactly why we need better tools—tools that make learning easier, faster, more fun.

That’s why we’re building Zoonk. For those who have been told it’s too late. For those who, deep down, still believe in their childhood dreams—before they were told to accept reality as it is.

Because **we believe anyone can learn anything. Anyone can do anything.** And when you realize that, everything changes.

We want a world where knowledge is accessible. A world where more people have the chance to push boundaries, make discoveries, and drive change. A world where more people have the power to tackle humanity’s greatest challenges.

Education can change the world. But first, we need to change education.

## 🔧 How We Work

We build Zoonk based on these values:

- **Care**: We care about what we build, who we build it for, and the problems we solve. Quality over quantity—it’s not about having the most features, but the best ones.
- **Transparency**: No secrets, no hidden agendas. We’re open, honest, and direct about everything.
- **Ownership**: We take responsibility. If something goes wrong, we own it, learn, and fix it. We’re proactive—improving things without waiting for permission.
- **Sharing**: Everything we build is open-source. Collaboration beats competition—everyone contributing is part of the team.
- **Growth**: Mistakes fuel learning. We take risks, adapt fast, and stay humble, knowing there’s always more to learn.
- **Inclusion**: Great products come from diverse teams. Different perspectives lead to better solutions. Every voice matters—we make sure everyone is heard, respected, and included.

## 🚀 Where We’re Headed

We want to accelerate progress by making learning better for everyone. This means building the best tools to help you learn anything—fast, easy, and fun. One day, learning even complex topics like general relativity should feel as easy and fun as playing a video game.
