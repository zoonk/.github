## 🌍 Why We Are Building This

Society is changing fast, and AI is reshaping how we live and work. To keep up, people need scientific literacy, critical thinking, and lifelong learning. Education must be fun, practical, and engaging so everyone can adapt and thrive in a world that never stops evolving.

## 🧠 What We Are Building

We’re creating a platform where:

- You can learn anything, fast and easily.
- Learning adapts to your interests.
- Practical exercises connect knowledge to real life.
- Everything is explained in clear, simple language.
- You gain real skills to solve real problems.
- You’ll connect with opportunities and ambitious people tackling the world’s biggest challenges. (Coming in 2026)

## 🔧 How We Work

We build Zoonk based on these values:

- **Care**: We care about what we build, who we build it for, and the problems we solve. Quality over quantity—it’s not about having the most features, but the best ones.
- **Transparency**: No secrets, no hidden agendas. We’re open, honest, and direct about everything.
- **Ownership**: We take responsibility. If something goes wrong, we own it, learn, and fix it. We’re proactive—improving things without waiting for permission.
- **Sharing**: Everything we build is open-source. Collaboration beats competition—everyone contributing is part of the team.
- **Growth**: Mistakes fuel learning. We take risks, adapt fast, and stay humble, knowing there’s always more to learn.
- **Inclusion**: Great products come from diverse teams. Different perspectives lead to better solutions. Every voice matters—we make sure everyone is heard, respected, and included.

## 🚀 Where We’re Headed

We want to accelerate progress by making learning better for everyone. That means building the best tools to help you learn anything—fast, easy, and fun. One day, even complex topics like general relativity should feel as intuitive and engaging as playing a video game.
